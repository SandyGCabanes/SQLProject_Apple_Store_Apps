# SQLProject_Apple_Store_Apps
## Part 1: Exploratory data analysis using Guided video <br>

**SQL USED:** I imported the data using [SQLite online](https://sqliteonline.com/) per the guided video of LoreSoWhat in YouTube.<br>
**Queries:** I followed the SQL queries from the video [here](https://github.com/SandyGCabanes/SQLProject_Apple_Store_Apps/blob/main/LoreSoWhatCodeSQLite.sql)

**DATA SOURCE:** Dataset link courtesy of LoreSoWhat [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14O9xB8N1gXN_67ouphImQkvpzyitmTfR) <br>

## Part 2: Exploratory data analysis using my own questions <br>
**USING MY OWN SQL QUESTIONS THAT SPARKED MY CURIOSITY**<br>
Further analysis of the Apps to beat based on previous exploratory analysis and assumptions for the App Developer:
- PAID apps that have top user ratings among top 5 categories from previous analysis
- If App developer still wants to develop games, what are the games to beat
  - based on paid, user_rating, cont_rating, etc.

**SQL USED:** [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)<br>
**Queries:** I created my own queries in this [sql file](https://github.com/SandyGCabanes/SQLProject_Apple_Store_Apps/blob/main/SandyDataAnalysisSQLite.sql) <br>
**Findings:** The sheet named "Non-Guided_SQL_Questions" has the outputs from the Queries I made. [excel file - Click 'View raw' to Open the file online](https://github.com/SandyGCabanes/SQLProject_Apple_Store_Apps/blob/main/FindingsAppleSQL.xlsx) <br>

### Many thanks to *@LoreSoWhat* for encouraging us to *create our own queries* based on the queries that he started.
